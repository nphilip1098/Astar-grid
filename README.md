# Astar-grid

Given a grid(picture) of a environment, a  starting point and an ending point, this application calculates the shortest path using A* Algorithm.
 
(i)The grid can be sketched using any tool.
(ii)The obstacles are treated as 1 and free space is treated as 0.( so an inversion is applied on the image.(255 --> 0))
